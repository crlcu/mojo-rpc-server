This is an RPC webserver written in Mojolicious.

Simply clone it, update the config to whitelist which Classes and Methods are allowed and off you go.

In the config you can specify extra lib directories to load in, and any modules that need requiring at startup for them.

Look at mojo-rpc-client for a client module for this server.

For running with hypnotoad do the following

MOJO_MODE=uat hypnotoad ./script/mojo_rpc 

Replace uat with the config you want to use

make sure you have a line like this in your config

hypnotoad => {listen => ['http://*:8005'], workers => 10},
